# Contributing to StellarSwipe-Contract

## Scaffold a new contract crate

Use the scaffold generator to create a new contract crate already wired with the
shared **Pausable**, **Initializable**, and **StorageTrait** conventions:

```bash
# From the repository root
./stellar-swipe/scripts/scaffold_contract.sh <contract_name>
```

### Example

```bash
./stellar-swipe/scripts/scaffold_contract.sh reward_distributor
```

This creates:

```
stellar-swipe/contracts/reward_distributor/
├── Cargo.toml          # depends on soroban-sdk + stellar-swipe-common
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs          # initialize / pause / unpause / storage_write / storage_read
    └── tests.rs        # starter tests covering init, pause, storage round-trip
```

The workspace `Cargo.toml` is updated automatically to include the new crate.

### Verify the scaffold

```bash
cd stellar-swipe
cargo test   -p stellar-swipe-reward-distributor
cargo clippy -p stellar-swipe-reward-distributor -- -D warnings
```

Both should pass with no manual fixes required.

### What the scaffold includes

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Initializable guard | `initialize()` panics/returns error on double-init |
| Pausable | `pause()` / `unpause()` / `is_paused()` with events |
| StorageTrait pattern | `storage_write(key, value)` / `storage_read(key)` blocked while paused |
| Starter test file | `tests.rs` with 5 tests covering all three features |

Extend `DataKey` and `{ContractName}Error` with your contract-specific variants
before adding business logic.

## Checked arithmetic for financial amounts

Financial amounts (fees, P&L, balances, stakes — anything denominated in a
Stellar 7-decimal `i128`) must not use raw `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators, since
those panic on overflow in debug builds and wrap or panic unpredictably
otherwise (Soroban release profile sets `overflow-checks = true`).

Use `stellar_swipe_common::Amount` instead:

```rust
use stellar_swipe_common::Amount;

let total = Amount::new(a).checked_add(Amount::new(b))?; // Result<Amount, AmountError>
let fee = principal.checked_mul_rate(fee_bps, 10_000)?;   // principal * fee_bps / 10_000
```

`Amount` intentionally has no `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul`/`Div` impls, so attempting
`amount_a + amount_b` is a compile error. Functions that perform financial
arithmetic should additionally carry `#[warn(clippy::arithmetic_side_effects)]`
on the function item — CI runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
warnings`, so any raw arithmetic introduced inside that function fails the
build (see `contracts/fee_collector/src/rebates.rs::record_trade_volume` and
`contracts/user_portfolio/src/queries.rs::compute_get_pnl` for examples).

This is scoped per-function rather than per-crate because the workspace sets
`clippy::all = "allow"` broadly (issue #599) — a crate-wide deny would also
flag unrelated, already-safe loop/index arithmetic across these large crates.
